      "few examples of things which we can see now, which I think will be big in the next 20 years. A lot\n",
      "of it to do with IT, with computers, with robots. The first one is this mysterious thing (points to\n",
      "picture of UAV on screen). This unidentified flying object was seen at a BMT passing out parade\n",
      "on the (Marina Bay) floating platform recently. It created buzz on the Internet. People asked is\n",
      "this a secret spy project belonging to MINDEF. So I asked MINDEF, \"is this a secret spy project?\"\n",
      "MINDEF told me, after investigating the matter carefully, they said no, it has nothing to do with\n",
      "me. This is a UAV, an unmanned aerial vehicle. No pilot but it flies, it is smart. And whom does it\n",
      "belong to? jack Neo filming his latest movie, 'Ah Boys to Men!' It is just one of many users which\n",
      "UAVs will have in the future. Militaries use them - reconnaissance targeting, communications;\n",
      "civilians use them. You can use them for crowd control, you can use them for civil defence\n",
      "purposes, you can use them to manage crops, to keep track of what is happening on broad\n",
      "areas. So many countries are interested in this.\n",
      "The US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) ran a competition recently on the\n",
      "Internet for people to design UAVs, using crowd sourcing. There was an NTU team which\n",
      "participated in this competition. The competition was called \"uavforge.net \" and the NTU team\n",

      "the people whom they came ahead of, one was from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n",
      "(MIT) and the other one was from the Japanese Ministry of Defence. So I think that we did well.\n",
      "One day when you fly SIA, you may fly a UAV. It will take some time but it is technically possible.\n",
      "What I am not so sure is possible is that you can have something replace a Singapore Girl and\n",
      "that I think the human touch will be there for some time to come. But UAVs are examples of\n",
      "robot technology, computers and artificial intelligence which are going to be pervasive. In\n",

      "How will these technological advances affect us? It is not just a \"gee whiz\" factor, cute to talk\n",
      "about. But it is going to cause the whole economy to change, entire industries to alter. Retailers\n",
      "are under pressure from online shops whether they are selling books, Amazon, whether they are\n",
      "selling videos. It is not even video delivered by mail but video comes down your broadband. Even\n",
      "groceries you can order, it will be delivered. No need for the shop, no need for the expensive\n",

      "retrained, learn to use technology, how to raise productivity. You may be cleaning but you cannot\n",

      "personal secretary will have to become an office manager to do other things which a phone\n",
      "cannot do. Our social norms will change, how we communicate with one another, how we interact\n",
      "with one another. It is going to transform Singapore in many ways which we can't tell.\n",

      "aspirations, every parent wants his or her son to do as well as possible, go to university, and\n",
      "many ITE students hope to go on to the poly and most poly students aspire to get a degree one\n",
      "way or another, they want to get there. So we have been increasing our university places year by\n",
      "year for Singaporeans but still more Singaporeans want to go. So last year, I tasked Lawrence\n",
      "Wong to study this issue. And he concluded that we should create more university places and\n",
      "that we should focus on applied practice-oriented degrees. For example engineers,\n",
      "physiotherapists, social workers, skills which are useful, which are in demand, which will help to\n",
      "get the graduates jobs. We should not just churn out graduates regardless of the quality or the\n",
      "employment opportunities - set up the institutions, run the courses, print the degrees, produce\n",
      "the graduates, generate a lot of disappointment and unhappiness. Other countries have made\n",

      "that if we let people go that way and encourage people to go that way, that at the end the\n",
      "prospects are good.\n",
      "Right now we have two institutions that work closely with industry and emphasize practice\n",
      "oriented teaching. One is SIM University called UNISIM, which is a private institution and it runs\n",
      "part-time courses for adult students and it collaborates closely with the industry. For example it\n",
      "runs aerospace systems courses and the courses include a practicum, meaning the students have\n",
      "to spend a certain number of hours or weeks with a company in the industry, working in the\n",
      "company, learning about the practical aspects of aerospace engineering and they do the same\n",
      "with the social workers and the other courses. The other institution is SIT, the Singapore Institute\n",
      "of Technology, which has high quality foreign partners in focussed areas. For example one\n",
      "partner is DigiPen which is one of the top American institutions for interactive digital media and\n",
      "here you will see the student rendering something and the younger ones among you will know\n",
      "that this thing is called an AT-ST, Star Wars, All Terrain Scout Transport Walker. I confess I did not\n",
      "know, I had to learn but the young ones know and they are going to master this. SIT is partnering\n",

      "foreign partners. So what will we do? We will increase the full.time places for applied degrees. We\n",
      "will make SIT and UniSIM our fifth and our sixth universities. SIT will expand and it will award\n",
      "degrees in its own name in addition to the partnerships it has. UniSIM will add full-time\n",
      "programmes to its parttime courses and it will build on its strong industry links but it will\n",
      "remain a private university. And that way we can increase the current full time university intake\n",
      "by a total of 3,000 students a year by 2020. In other words, today we take in 13,000\n",
      "undergraduates a year, first year, by 2020 we will take in 16,000 students a year. 3,000 more\n",
      "and that would mean 40 per cent of each cohort will go to university, up from 27 per cent today\n",
      "and that would include more poly students and more JC students and I think that it will help to\n",
      "meet the aspirations of many Singaporeans.\n",
      "That is for full time but at the same time, I think we should not forget the part time students, the\n",
      "adult students. UniSIM runs part time courses, I visited them recently, I was impressed with them,\n",
      "with their students too. Most of their students are in their late 20s or 30s, mostly poly graduates,\n",
      "gone out to work and decided to resume their studies while working. I chatted with some of them\n",
      "and I asked them why did you want to do this, take this path? They said well, when they left\n",

      "Married with children, with jobs, but they have decided to do it and they were going to make it\n",
      "succeed. So I found them mature, clear in their own minds, what they wanted to do in their lives,\n",
      "determined to succeed, quite a different profile from young students who go straight to\n",
      "university and for whom all possibilities are still open. So it needs tremendous commitment and\n",
      "grit to succeed if you go to UniSIM and I think we should help people like that. Sometimes both\n",

      "option for some segment of our students to leave school, go to work and then later on when you\n",
      "are clearer what you want to do, do something which is focused, practical and will help take your\n",
      "life aims forward. So we should give them more support How? We will make more part time\n",
      "places available and secondly we will extend government bursaries and loans to UniSIM part-time\n",
      "students, so that they get the same support as part time students in NUS and NTU.\n",
      "When I met the students, some of them asked me, can you allow us to take our CPF for education\n",
      "just like people can for the full-time courses? I said no, you are working, you have\n",
      "responsibilities, your CPF is for your house and your future, we will give you more support, I will\n",
      "prefer the government help you rather than you take from your CPF and I think with the bursaries\n",
      "and with the loans and with the scholarships, this will help those who have some financial\n",
      "difficulties to achieve their ambitions and their aspirations. MOE will announce the details later\n",

      "develop yourselves, learn something useful, make a contribution to society.\n",
      "At the other end of the education system, we also need to improve the quality of our preschool\n",
      "education. Once upon a time, education used to start when you went to school and entered\n",
      "Primary One or Standard One. My mother's generation it was like that, about 90 years ago now,\n",
      "she only learnt to read when she went to school and it wasn't because she was disadvantaged or\n",
      "deprived, it was the norm; that was how kids learnt. And she never felt any loss and she managed\n",
      "perfectly well in life. But when it came to my turn, she sent me at a young age to Nanyang\n",
      "kindergarten to learn Mandarin and that was SO plus years ago, times had changed by then and\n",
      "times have changed even more now. Family structures have evolved, there are more nuclear\n",

      "opportunities for the kids to socialize at home with grandparents, with elder siblings, with\n",

      "pronunciation. It is an age where kids can gain confidence and curiosity about the world around\n",
      "them - What is that? Let's go and explore, let's take a small risk, learn what is dangerous and\n",
      "what is not. It is also when kids should pick up positive behaviour, social skills and learning\n",
      "attitudes - when to queue up, take your turn, share. And so good preschool education will\n",

      "per cent, nearly all children, in fact more than 99 per cent of kids already attend preschool. There\n",
      "is a diverse mix of operators. Two key anchor operators, we call them AOPs, one is NTUC, the\n",
      "other one is PAP Community Foundation. They are the anchor operators, they have just under\n",
      "half of the total market and many different private providers as well. The government provides\n",
      "financial support to make preschool affordable. And we also provide support to the anchor\n",
      "operators to raise their standards. We have been doing this for several years, we are making\n",
      "progress but I think it is not enough and we have to do more. I think we have to substantially\n",
      "raise the quality of preschool education for children aged 5 and 6 years old especially the AOPs,\n",
      "the mass market anchor operators and at the same time we have to keep preschool affordable\n",
      "especially to the middle and lower income households because if you are going to raise\n",
      "standards considerably, it is going to mean more resources, higher costs, you are going to\n",

      "to do that, without raising the cost to their parents, and keeping it affordable, the government\n",
      "has to come in. Our objective is to level up all our students and make a positive difference to\n",
      "their development especially the students from the disadvantaged homes. So the government will\n",
      "invest substantial resources in preschool education and play a more active role.\n",
      "First of all, we will establish a new statutory board to oversee preschool education. Secondly, we\n",

      "they can introduce creative learning methods for the students but to raise the base, the quality of\n",
      "the mass market. Fifthly, we will pilot a few government run pre-school centres to test new\n",
      "concepts in kindergarten education. Finally, we will give more support to lower and middle\n",
      "income families so that it stays affordable. But we will not nationalize the pre-school sector. I\n",
      "read the debates in the newspapers over the last few months. Some people want the government\n",
      "to 'pow ka liao' (cover all bases). I think the government has a role to play but the government's\n",
      "role is not to do everything. There's a mix of operators and I think having a mix of operators\n",
      "offers diversity and choice. I think the choice is useful for parents because different parents will\n",
      "have different views, what their kids need and different kids will have different needs. So we\n",

      "The transformation will take some time but I am confident that in five to seven years, we will be\n",
      "able to see results but I would like to offer one caution to parents: Please let your children have\n",
      "their childhood! Pre-school is to teach the kids certain skills which are best learnt at that age,\n",
      "language, social skills, basic motor skills. It is not meant for you to prepare with the Primary One,\n",

      "turn the kid off, you make his life miserable. Instead of growing up balanced and happy, he\n",

      "A BIGGER HEART\n",
      "Education is vital to the future of Singapore, to creating hope for a better tomorrow and hope is\n",
      "essential to our future and to the Singapore story. But besides hope, Singapore tomorrow must\n",
      "also have a bigger heart. Care and compassion for the needy and elderly, but also a largeness of\n",
      "spirit, a generosity, magnanimity to those who are around us. It reflects the sort of people we are\n",
      "and the values which we hold dear. We have for a long time recognized the importance of taking\n",
      "care of the less fortunate members of society. We have worked hard to build an inclusive society\n",
      "and enabled everyone to enjoy the fruits of progress, especially the weak and the elderly and the\n",
      "disabled, through housing, through education, through healthcare - heavily subsidized and\n",
      "widely available. But especially and more fundamentally through growth, prosperity which has\n",
      "created jobs and improved lives for all. Over the last decades, new needs have emerged. Society\n",
      "has become stretched out, somewhat stratified, we get pressure of globalization, so we have\n",
      "addressed these new social needs with new programs, Workfare, Comcare, additional housing\n",
      "grants, special housing grants, so many schemes, so many ways to help but the objective is\n",
      "targeted to uplift Singaporeans who need help. In this year's Budget we made a major shift with\n",
      "an Inclusive Budget with significant initiatives for the elderly like the Silver Housing Bonus, for the\n",
      "low and middle income like the GST vouchers, for the disabled like daycare activity centres. We\n",
      "are not just spending more but we are setting a new strategic direction for Singapore and laying\n",
      "the basis for stronger social safety nets which will stand the' testof the next couple of decades\n",
      "because we are striking a new balance in our social compact, what you must do as individuals, as\n",
      "families and what the state will help you to do so that we can advance together. What we have\n",
      "started in the budget we will build on in the years to come. But I would like as always to have a\n",
      "caution, have a care, three cautions. First, inclusiveness does not just mean more good things\n",
      "from the state or falling from heaven. All benefits have to be paid for. People say you are rich,\n",
      "you have reserves. We are already relying on reserves, spending part of the returns from\n",
      "investing these reserves. It is what Ministry of Finance calls NIRC, Net Investment Returns\n",
      "Contributions. It is an item in the budget. When you invest the money every year it grows, you\n",
      "take a bit of that growth or half of that growth and we use it for our spending. It has helped us\n",
      "fund many new programs and still balance our budget without having to push up taxes sharply.\n",
      "Last year FY 2011, from the reserves we got $8 billion to spend. We got more money from the\n",
      "reserves to spend than we got by collecting personal income taxes and I think it is four times as\n",
      "much as we got from COEs. It is not a small amount of money. It is one seventh of our \n",
      "expenditure every year, comes from our reserves. We are already drawing on this. If the reserves\n",
      "grow, you may get more. If the reserves do not, we will have to live with less. But we have to draw\n",
      "from the reserves in a sustainable way so that it stays there and you can continue to have money\n",
      "there year after year. We cannot just spend everything on ourselves. We have a responsibility to\n",
      "the future, to the next generation and we have to husband these reserves so that the next\n",
      "generation will not say my grandparents they spent it all.\n",
      "If you look ahead, the state is bound to spend more on social services. We are ageing, medical\n",
      "science is progressing. Every year the demands will increase and these demands will have to be\n",
      "partially met from the state. Social spending will go up. In many countries the politicians\n",
      "champion social spending but they pretend it does not cost the taxpayers anything. Even in\n",
      "Singapore sometimes people tell you, does not matter, that is just a social investment Since it is\n",
      "an investment it will look after itself. But let me tell you the truth, as our social spending\n",
      "increases significantly, sooner or later our taxes must go up. Not immediately but if you are\n",
      "talking about 20 years, certainly within that 20 years whoever is the government will at some\n",
      "point have to raise taxes because the spending will have to be done and the spending will have to\n",
      "be paid for and I hope that the government of the day will have the gumption to do that and the\n",
      "population of the day will have the good sense to support that. That is the first caveat. Nothing\n",
      "falls from heaven.\n",
      "The second message is that social safety nets have to be coupled with self reliance and resilience.\n",
      "We have to want to do the best for ourselves. People have to be motivated to make the effort to\n",
      "strive, not just to queue up and get something from the state. The state will help you where it\n",
      "can but it cannot replace what you and your family can do for yourself and each other. To survive\n",
      "we have to be resilient, tough as individuals, close as families, cohesive as a society, strong as a\n",
      "nation. We have to be prepared to compete and to hold our own. The competition is there, there\n",
      "is no place to hide. The government can help to enable you to meet the competition. It is not\n",
      "possible for us to say we keep the competition away, there are big bad wolves who are outside,\n",
      "you are quite safe at home, nothing to worry about Competition is there, we have to be tough\n",
      "enough. Sometimes, something will go wrong and when we encounter setbacks, we must have\n",
      "the spunk to pick ourselves up, dust off whatever stuck to us and press on.\n",
      "The third caveat I have is we must maintain a sense of mutual responsibility amongst ourselves\n",
      "and especially on the part of those who are more successful than others. You have succeeded by\n",
      "working hard, through your own efforts, yes, but you have also benefitted from the system which\n",
      "nurtured you and from the many others who helped you to do well. President Obama in America\n",
      "said this recently. He got flamed because it got politicized. Obama said if you succeed, it is not\n",
      "because of yourself but this is exactly what he meant. You may be a great entrepreneur, you may\n",
      "be a very successful banker, you may have invented something but there were schools, there\n",
      "were parents, there were teachers, there was a society, there is a system which enabled you to do\n",
      "well. Without that you would have been nothing and I think our successful people have to know\n",
      "that and also have to feel that obligation that it is right that having done well, they make the\n",
      "effort to help others too.\n",
      "One way to do this is by starting a social enterprise. One lady who started something is Josephine\n",
      "Ng who started a social enterprise called Alteration Initiative. Josephine used to run a marketing\n",
      "agency, did well but then she decided she wanted to do something more, sold it and to give back\n",
      "to society. She founded Alteration Initiative and what it does is to provide professional alteration\n",
      "services and the employees are women in need. She trains them as seamstresses, she gives them\n",
      "decent salaries and Alteration Initiative not just alters clothes but transforms their employees'\n",
      "lives as well.\n",
      "Besides social welfare, another aspect of having a big heart is very important and that is: knowing\n",

      "one idea is we create a Medisave account for each kid when it is born, when he or she is born and\n",
      "we put a small hongbao in for him to start life and you can defray the childhood medical\n",

      "motivations. Singaporeans will marry and have children because of the fulfillment that having a\n",
